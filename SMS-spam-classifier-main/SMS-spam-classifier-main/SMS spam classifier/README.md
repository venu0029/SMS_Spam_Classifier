# 📱 SMS Spam Classifier

An **end-to-end Machine Learning project** that classifies SMS messages as **spam** or **ham (not spam)** using Machine Learning (ML) techniques.  

This project demonstrates applied ML skills — **data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and interpretation** — all in a single reproducible Jupyter Notebook.

## 🚀 Project Highlights
- **Complete ML Pipeline**: From raw text to evaluated model in one notebook.  
- **Multiple Models**: Includes Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and more for performance comparison.  
- **Explainable Outputs**: Confusion matrix, precision/recall/F1 scores, and feature importance.  
- **Well-documented Notebook**: Easy to follow, great for interviews or portfolio display.  
- **Real-world Relevance**: Spam filtering is crucial for fraud prevention and better user experience.
